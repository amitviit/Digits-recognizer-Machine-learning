# Digits-recognizer-Machine-learning
Train a machine learning model using a dataset of handwritten digits.


Hello,

In this project, I have attempted to create three different machine learning models namely:

1. K-nearest neighbor
2. SVM
3. Neural Net 

which will attempt to recognize handwritten images.

Dataset: MNIST dataset is used which is a modified version of NIST data of images of handwritten digits. This dataset contains 60000 training examples and 10000 test examples

I have exclusively used python and various machine learning libraries such as keras, sklearn and some others like numpy, matplotlib for playing with the data

Please refer to the attached file for code.
